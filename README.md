# Valuable Drop Prices
This plugin adds the option to display High Alch prices, in the Valuable Drops notification in chat.
The plugin is **still under development**, but should be working well.

**Make sure the default drop notifications are enabled!**

You can set a minimum amount for notifications, if you want only the GE price, the HA price, or both at the same time.
You can also modify the colour of the chat notification.
(Colour modifications, as well as which price has priority is temporarily disabled as I work on a better implementation)
